# Vulnerable A records (IP addresses)
*optional feature turned off by default*

* detects A records pointing to AWS IP addresses no longer in use within organisation
  * Elastic IP addresses
  * EC2 instances with public IP addresses
  * ECS Fargate public IP addresses
  * Global Accelerator IP addresses
* automated takeover not supported

## How an A record becomes vulnerable
A records pointing to an IPv4 address can be vulnerable to subdomain takeover:

* engineer creates EC2 instance with public IP address
* engineer creates Route53 A record pointing to address
* engineer deletes EC2 instance, releasing IP address
* engineer forgets to remove Route53 DNS record
* attacker creates EC2 instance in own AWS account, with same IP address
* company DNS record now points to attacker's virtual machine

## How Domain Protect determines if A record is vulnerable
* decision flow designed to minimise false positives
* only detects certain types of A record vulnerabilities

## Domain Protect IP address database
* DynamoDB database table for IP addresses in Organization
* separate from vulnerability DynamoDB table

## Record IP address as OK
The A record check may create false positive alerts.

If A record points to legitimate IP address, e.g. in a service provider's AWS account:
* manually create item in IP address DynamoDB database
* enter IP address known to be authorised
* create Account field with text starting `IP OK`
* item must be manually removed when resource is decommissioned

## Enabling A record feature
* set Terraform variable in your CI/CD pipeline or tfvars file:
```
ip_address = true
```
* apply Terraform

## First time usage
* IP address database is populated by first scan
* vulnerability scans run once items are shown in database under `Item count`
* requires at least one IP address in database
* it may take up to 6 hours for DynamoDB to update `Item count`

## Minimising false positives
False positive alerts can occur when an 'A' record legitimately points
to an IP address in an AWS account outside your organisation,
for example a company website hosted by a third party.

To minimise false positive alerts when enabling feature in production for the first time:
* set Terraform environment variable for a private dev Slack channel in your pipeline or `tfvars` file
```
slack_channels_dev = ["test_a_records"]
```
* enable A record feature
```
ip_address = true
```
* don't apply Terraform to production yet
* deploy a development instance of Domain Protect to your production security audit account
```
terraform workspace new dev
terraform apply
```
* leave running for 48 hours
* monitor dev Slack channel
* assess which IP addresses are legitimate
* deploy A record feature to production
```
terraform workspace select prd
terraform apply
```
* immediately after deploying, [record IP address as OK](#record-ip-address-as-ok) for legitimate addresses
* complete before DynamoDB `DomainProtectIPsPrd` item count updates from initial value of `0`
* remove development instance of Domain Protect if no longer needed

## Optimising cost and performance
Optional Terraform variables can be entered in your CI/CD pipeline or tfvars file to optimise performance and cost:

* `ip_scan_schedule` can be reduced from `24 hours` for improved security at greater cost
* `ip_time_limit` can be reduced from `48` hours for improved security but higher risk of false positives
* `allowed_regions` can be limited to those allowed by Service Control Policies, to reduce Lambda execution time and cost
