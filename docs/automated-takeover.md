# Automated takeover
*optional feature turned on by default in production*
* take over vulnerable subdomains yourself before attackers and bug bounty researchers
* automated takeover with resources created in security account

## Slack messages
* notification of takeover success or failure:

* daily report of resources in security account:

## supported resource types
* Elastic Beanstalk environments
* S3 buckets

## Domain Protect tests supporting automated takeover
* Alias records for CloudFront distributions with missing S3 origin
* CNAME records for CloudFront distributions with missing S3 origin
* Elastic Beanstalk Alias records vulnerable to takeover
* Elastic Beanstalk CNAMES vulnerable to takeover
* S3 Alias records vulnerable to takeover
* S3 CNAMES vulnerable to takeover
* Cloudflare CNAMES for S3 buckets and Elastic Beanstalk environments

## Deleting takeover resources
To minimise costs these tasks should be done as quickly as possible:
* fix the vulnerability by correcting DNS
* in the case of S3, empty the S3 bucket manually via the console
* delete the CloudFormation stack manually via the console

## enabling automated takeover
* automated takeover is automatically enabled for the `prd` terraform workspace
* takeover only runs in production environment to avoid conflicts
* production workspace identifier can be changed by overriding `production_workspace` variable

## disabling automated takeover
* takeover can be turned off completely in all environments by setting variable `takeover = false`

## automated takeover components
Automated takeover components:
* takeover Lambda - takes over vulnerable domains by creating resources
* resources Lambda - reports on takeover resources in security account

## takeover event flow
Example takeover event flow:

## Adding takeover feature to existing deployment
If you have previously deployed a detection only environment:
* add the `cloudfront:ListDistributions` permission to the [audit policy](../aws-iam-policies/domain-protect-audit.json) in every account
* update line 59 of the [domain-protect-deploy policy](../aws-iam-policies/domain-protect-deploy.json) in security account
* ensure your production Terraform workspace is `prd`
* alternatively add your actual workspace name as the value of the `production_workspace` variable
* apply Terraform

## Service Control Policies
Ensure AWS Organization Service Control Policies applied to security account allow:
* creation of takeover resources, i.e. S3 buckets and Elastic Beanstalk environments
* all regions used by any other AWS account in the Organization

## S3 Block Public Access
* S3 Block Public Access must not be turned on at the account level in the security account
* takeover S3 buckets need to be public for correct operation
